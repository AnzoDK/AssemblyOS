Current (wrong) formular:
(width*y)+(x*2)
y = 1
x = 0
(1*80)+(0*2) = 80 : Expected answer: 160 (as we only work on every second byte due to the VGA array being a 16bit array)

Test: (width*(y*2))+(x*2)
y = 1
x = 0
((1*2)*80)+(0*2) = 160 : Expected answer: 160
y = 2
x = 0
((2*2)*80)+(0*2) = 320 : Expected answer: 320

This formular seems to solve it :D
