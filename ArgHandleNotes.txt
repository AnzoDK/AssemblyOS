Stack alligned to 4

::USE OF EBP INSTEAD OF ESP::
push arg1#12
push arg2#8

##Call happens here## #4

push EBP # Store old EBP #0

mov ESP, EBP
sub 8, ESP # ESP-(sizeof(localVariable a)+sizeof(localVariable b)) - only needed for local variables
arg1 = 12(EBP)
arg2 = 8(EBP)

::ALLOCATION OF NEW LOCAL VARIABLES:: THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH PUSH OR POP - MEANING FUNCTION CALLS ARE A PROBLEM UNLESS EXTRA SPACE IS RESERVED FOR IT

mov 4, EAX #local variable 4
mov EAX, -4(EBP) #store it


::END THE FUNCTION::
mov EBP, ESP
pop EBP
ret
